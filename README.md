Cat Camera project

This is my first time programming a microcontroller or even doing a project of this sort. The main goal behind this is to be able to view my cats and monitor their enivornment whilst out of the house.

The plan is to add a camera module, temperature, and humidity and link this up to an app or remote service where I can view this information.
