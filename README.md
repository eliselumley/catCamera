Cat Camera project

This is my first time programming a microcontroller or even doing a project of this sort. The main goal behind this is to be able to view my cats and monitor their enivornment whilst out of the house.

The plan is to add a camera module, temperature, and humidity and link this up to an app or remote service where I can view this information. 

Timeline:
  I have currently implemented a DHT11 sensor on the ESP32 board. This worked successfully but the temperature sensor was reading 2 degrees celsius higher than my chefs thermometer, leading me to believe this sensor is inaccurate or maybe broken.
